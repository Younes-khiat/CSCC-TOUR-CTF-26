using file commend or "die" tool we can see that its windows file 
└─$ file chal3.exe
chal3.exe: PE32 executable for MS Windows 4.00 (GUI), Intel i386, 15 sections

we need to use wine to run it or to have windows system

first thing we do we run it and we see that it have GUI that prompte us to type password then check 


when using ida as decompiling we see alot of generated code that is not related to GUI 
its like template code thate is added on every app that have  GUI so by time you will
memorizes the exact location of the user code

first go to the buttom until you find return WinMain(ModuleHandleA, 0, CommandLineA, wShowWindow);
click on WinMain , in this page you will find related information to the windows tab it self(
icon, title colors .... and some gui template,   they are not intersting)

then go to WndClass.lpfnWndProc = WndProc; and click on WndProc

here you find the user code 

[Screenshot_2.png]

here it handles user interaction with buttons(close windows button, and other existing buttons)
text if they are, keyboard buttons , and any other type of interaction can the user do
when we run the app we see text area and check button

case 1u → WM_CREATE This message is sent when the window is being created. (not intersting)
case 2u → WM_DESTROY This message is sent when the window is closing. (not intersting)

case 0x111u: // this wehere the check button handled
      if ( (_WORD)wParam == 1 )
        check_password(hWndParent);             lets dive deeper here
      break;

first it set string with full of zeroes then it reads from the text bar the input of user
then it set the string character to lower, meanign typing test and TEST will give the same result later
then it calculate its lenght, if it > 16 then it uses only the first 16 character
it copy the new calculated size to v16

then we see crusial part : 
    for ( j = 1; j <= 15; ++j )
        v16[j] = v16[0];

its overide the input with the first charcter dublicated
if the input cas CSCC then the outpuet will be CCC... (16 times)
and then it uses the new key to decryprt some blob of hex 

by analysing what we saw we know that the only first chracter of the inpute is what count the
rest will be discared and since every uppercase char will be lower we even have smaller possiblities
to test which they are: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?/~`\"'

since they are few we test one by one and when we reach the letter t we get the flag
flag: CSCC{brut3_f0rc3_th3_k3y_byt3}
