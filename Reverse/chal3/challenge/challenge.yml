  The vibe coder made a critical bug in his code. Can you find it?

  This is a Windows GUI application protected by AES encryption.
  The program asks for a password, derives an AES-128 key from it,
  and decrypts a fixed ciphertext to verify correctness.

  All visible strings are obfuscated at compile time, and the binary
  was built without optimization and without stripping symbols.

  The focus is on analyzing the key generation logic.

  Identify the flaw and recover the flag.
hints:
  - "Look closely at how the AES key buffer is filled."
  - "What happens to the remaining bytes of the key?"
  - "You might not need to reverse the entire AES routine."
