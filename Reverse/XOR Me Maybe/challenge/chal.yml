description: |
  A simple binary asks for a password and applies a transformation before checking it.
  The program uses a repeating key to modify your input and compares it against
  a predefined byte array.

  No optimization and no stripping were applied during compilation.

  Can you recover the correct password?
hints:
  - "Look carefully at how the input is transformed."
  - "XOR is its own inverse."
