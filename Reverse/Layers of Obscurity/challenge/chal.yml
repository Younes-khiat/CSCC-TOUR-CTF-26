description: |
  This binary performs multiple transformations on your input before validating it.
  The operations include byte reversal, XOR with a repeating key,
  and swapping adjacent byte pairs.

  The binary was compiled without optimization and without stripping symbols.

  Can you undo all layers and recover the correct password?
hints:
  - "Follow the transformations step by step."
  - "Each operation can be reversed."
  - "Obscurity alone is not security."
